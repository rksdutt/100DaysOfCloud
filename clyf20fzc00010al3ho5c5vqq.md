CloudFront is a managed AWS service that provide us solution for CDN (Content Delivery network). We interact with CDN in daily basis through application like Youtube, Instagram, Snapchat any of these image, video or content sharing platform all interact with CDN. AWS CloudFront makes it easier and cheaper to deliver data quickly with low latency, low network traffic, and quick data access with minimal cost. This has made AWS CloudFront very popular among organizations.

AWS CloudFront is a globally distributed network offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that securely transfers content such as software, SDKs, videos, etc. to clients with higher transfer speeds.

Overall, CloudFront is a fast and secure service that delivers content to millions of users worldwide It handles both static (like images and videos) and dynamic content (like individual web pages). Using a network of data centers called edge locations, CloudFront works seamlessly with AWS infrastructure. It supports AWS origin servers (such as EC2) or custom servers for content distribution, ensuring secure communication with free TLS certification. CloudFront includes DDoS protection with AWS Shield standard to protect against network attacks and maintain reliable availability. It integrates well with AWS for added security and meets industry standards. With Lambda@Edge, CloudFront lets you run complex application logic close to users, enabling serverless or highly dynamic web applications without the need to extend your own infrastructure. CloudFront offers cost-effective, free data migration from other AWS sources and a flexible pay-as-you-go pricing model, efficiently accelerating a variety of web traffic.
