Here we can easily put condition in our daily life. Pick that and lets put conditions on todays script.

Prerequisites are only make a dir to make them separate from the others.

**Step 1 :** We are going to create a .sh file whatever we wanna name it but it should match the subject.

```typescript
$ touch arejoeyfamous.sh 
or 
$ vim arejoeyfamous.sh
```

Step 2 : Now its time to put condition on joey's life through the script. All the script is saying that Joey wanna be a famous public figure although he's funny, handsome and he can act brilliant as well. So he bring his career on acting and to become a public figure he have to work hard and his skill percentage will show that how much he goes on this track . If it below 90% he is working hard , if it is over 90% then he became what he wants always. Can he be a public figure or not !! That's it. Let's write it...

```typescript
#!/bin/bash
#
#
<< disclaimer

This Time to Poke 
and ask him 
How's He Doing 
In His Life !!

disclaimer



read -p "Enter the profession Joey wanna Join : " Proffession

read -p "Enter the Skill % again : " Skill

if [[ $Proffession == Acting ]];
   [[ $Skill -lt 90 ]];

then
        echo "Joey bring his career on Acting Field"


elif [[ $Skill -gt 90 ]];

then

        echo "Joey Became a Public Figure"

else

        echo "Joey Is Working Hard to Become a Public Figure"
fi
```

Step 3 : Make the executeable and giving the permissions to who can do what to the file with this command.

```typescript
$ chmod 777 arejoeyfamous.sh
```

```typescript
$ bash filename.sh 
or 
$ ./arejoeyfamous.sh
```

Step 4 : We will take action from user like that and according to conditions the percentage will tell us in which stage he is now. Just play with it.
