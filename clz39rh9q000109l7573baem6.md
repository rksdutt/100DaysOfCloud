### Lets have a look on the AWS console

Overall, all we need to have a remarkable AWS console access whether you are a IAM User or ROOT User but best practices is to create and login with IAM and attach policies with it. Here we go to the EC2 dashboard and there we need to launch an instance.

Step 1 &gt; Launch an instance on AWS

Step 2 &gt; Ssh into the virtual machine which we've created successfully.

Then we are ssh into the instance & run out first command on vm server is here

Step 3 &gt; Let's cover the installation of nodejs

After successfully updated the vm then we are going to install nodejs cause without it there will be nothing. let's install...

Step 4 &gt; Checking version of nodejs essential for our mental satisfaction helthüòÅ.

After installing the nodejs on vm We need to check the installed version correctly.

Step 5 &gt; No need to worry about git installation, Git comes pre-installed with the virtual machine.

Step 6 &gt; Phew here we comes to the cloning part we just need to get the repo from remote to local by doing git clone https://github.com/username/reponame.git

Step 7 &gt; We need to set-up the environment files .

Why we need to setting it up cause environment file is .env file in Python is used to protect sensitive information and settings. They store things like passwords and configuration details separately from our code. This helps us to manage and organize these settings without putting them directly into our program. Clear !! to me !! yup !!

Fill the quotation with these which are mentioned below.

For Publishable and Nonpublishable key we are going through this link [https://docs.stripe.com/keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)

But here one more doubt why we need to expose port 3000 cause when we deploying a Node.js app to AWS we need to open port 3000 to let people access our app. Node.js apps typically run on port 3000. That's it !! Rest of them are in Rocket Science stream go check them out also...

Step 8 &gt; Remember we need to expose 3000 port on our security group. If you dont know about how to expose ports then google/yt it dont waste your precious time here.

Step 9 &gt; So we have cloned the repository & cd in to folder called AWS-session, Remember its crucial to check what is inside the repository.

Step 10 &gt; Once we step over those process we are going to run the command.

Step 11 &gt; And then after we run the command npm install we have to run this..

Step 12 &gt; We've reach to the End here we need to check out what we done so far.

Just picking our Pub IP & poking it on google with port 3000 ..
