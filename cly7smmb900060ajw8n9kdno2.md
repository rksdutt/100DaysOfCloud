Aws provides a comprehensive set of Continuous Infrastructure/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) services that allow us to automate our software delivery processes.

AWS have their own tools like - AWS Codepipeline AWS Codebuild AWS Codedeploy by using these service we can implents the entire CI/CD process within AWS.

**AWS Codecommit :** AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed cloud-based source control service hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows us to privately store and manage assets such as documents, source code, and binary files in the cloud. It doesn't need any users to installation or upgradation and configure or operate software.

We are using Github for our personal projects for place out code in it or contributing any open-source project. But when we work for an organization we don't use github public repositories we create private repositories in it. A lot of organizations install github on their servers or github also have enterprises solution organization can go with that. And some of them also used hosted git solution by downloading package on their own on premises servers.

**Here are some Advantages of AWS CodeCommit...**

**Security :** CodeCommit protects files both when they are stored and when they are transferred, making it suitable for storing a wide range of files from source code to binaries.

**Scalability :** CodeCommit can adjust its capacity to the amount of data it needs to handle, ensuring that it can increase or decrease the workload.

**Ease of use :** CodeCommit provides a straightforward interface and supports the Git workflow that many developers are already familiar with.

**Integration :** CodeCommit seamlessly works with other AWS services and third-party tools, accessible through AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.

**Community support :** CodeCommit is assisted by AWS with live support, ensuring support is readily available.

**Free tier :** CodeCommit's free tier includes unlimited repositories, 50 GB of storage monthly, and 10,000 Git requests per month, ideal for small teams and individual developers.

**Here are some disadvantages of AWS CodeCommit...**

**Menu options :** Some say the menu options are complicated.

**Triggers :** CodeCommit has finite triggers.

**CI system integration :** CodeCommit doesn't integrate with CI systems.

**Feedback :** CodeCommit doesn't provide feedback on flow and code evaluation.

**UI/UX :** Some say CodeCommit's UI/UX experience isn't as good as other similar tools, which can make it less usable.
