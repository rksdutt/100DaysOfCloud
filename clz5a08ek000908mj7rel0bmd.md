Ansible is a free & open-source tool used to automation & various operations such as configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and IT orchestration. Ansible is easy to set up, and it is efficient, reliable, and powerful, runs on Linux, Mac and BSD and helps streamline IT operations. There is also a paid version called 'Ansible Tower' that offers additional features for businesses.

### Why We Need Ansible !!

Okay, so managing servers before Ansible was a lot of manual work. For example, suppose I am in charge of nine servers, five of them for web work and four of them for databases. To set up Tomcat on the web server and MySQL on the database server, I had to manage each server individually - installing software, changing settings, and running services on each.

When I only have a few servers, it's manageable. But when technology evolves and I have more services and servers then it becomes difficult to do it manually for me. It's hard to keep everything organized and up-to-date. This can slow down developers who need to release updates quickly, while I, as a sysadmin, spend a lot of time on setup and maintenance.

That's why we need Ansible cause it automates these tasks, making server management easier, faster, and more consistent for me.

### Features of Ansible

**Agentless Operation :** Ansible works on managed servers without the need for additional software. It uses standard SSH for communication, which reduces risk and lowers maintenance costs. This agentless approach ensures efficient resource utilization and minimizes potential errors and cyber security threats.

**Python Support :** Ansible is built in Python and can be controlled through its Python API, which makes it easy to integrate with other systems. This Python-based design simplifies installation and operation and allows nodes to be controlled, responsive to Python events, develop plugins, and import data from external sources.

**Ssh Security :** Ansible uses secure SSH connections to manage servers which avoiding the need for passwords and increasing security. It connects to clients via SSH pushes modules to run locally and then retrieves results then ensuring a secure and efficient communication process.

**Push Architecture :** Ansible uses a push-based architecture to quickly update and configure servers by pushing changes to multiple servers simultaneously. This approach allows for quick configuration changes, improving both efficiency and control.

**Ease to Setup :** Ansible uses simple tools like playbooks, roles and inventories to organize and automate tasks and simplifying setup and management. This straightforward approach simplifies system configuration, software installation and continuous delivery and zero downtime deployment which ensure it efficient and organized operations.

### Workflows of Ansible

As more servers are added the service increases and we no longer have to manage everything manually. Instead we install Ansible on a central machine called the master node. Then we write a playbook which is a set of instructions for setting up and configuring the server. Ansible connects to those servers over a secure SSH connection using an inventory list and once it's connected it pushes playbook instructions to each server and configures them automatically. This simplifies server management and ensures that everything stays consistent.

### Architecture of Ansible

Ansible's architecture is straightforward and helps manage and automate tasks across multiple servers with a few core components. This is the core of Ansible which interacts with the user who writes instructions (called playbooks) and communicates with cloud services and databases to manage servers. Those components are mentioned below.

**Modules :** Ansible connects to the server and pushes small pieces of code called "Ansible Modules" to perform specific tasks. These modules are temporary they are used only when needed and removed later. We can write and manipulate these instructions using any text editor or terminal and track changes.

**Plugins :** A plugin is a piece of code that adds additional features to Ansible extending its core functionality. There are many useful built-in plugins, and you can create your own if needed.

**Inventory :** A list is a list of all servers and devices that Ansible manages including their IP addresses and other details. This helps Ansible know which machines to work with.

**Playbooks :** Playbooks are simple files written in YAML format that describe what Ansible needs to do. They list tasks that can be run one after the other or at the same time which making it easy to manage and automate the processes.

**APIs :** Ansible APIs allow Ansible to interact with both public and private cloud services acting as a bridge to manage and control them.

**Hosts :** Hosts are physical servers or devices like Windows, Linux, or other operating systems that Ansible manages and automates. These are the machines where Ansible executes tasks and applies configuration.

**Networking :** Ansible can automate network tasks and making it easy to manage different network devices and configurations. It uses a simple powerful framework that is agentless which allowing it to work efficiently across different network hardware. Automation is managed through playbooks or roles that are separated from responsive automation engines that are easily spread across different network hardware.

**CMDB :** A CMDB(Configuration Management DataBase) is a type of database that acts as a repository for storing information about all our IT resources and their configurations. It acts as a central data warehouse for managing IT installations.

**Cloud :** Ansible can manage data both on local servers and in the cloud means we can manage tasks on remote servers over the internet without needing to manage everything locally. Using cloud servers we can manage and process data remotely which making it easy to manage and scale our resources.

### Advantages of Ansible

Ansible is a free open source tool that can simplify and automate manual IT processes. Its main benefits include simplifying complex processes saving time and reducing errors.

**Ease of Learning :** Ansible are easy to learn, making it accessible to both novices and experts. Its simple design and clear documentation help users quickly understand how it works.

**Python Language :** Ansible is built with Python, a popular and easy-to-read programming language. This makes Ansible easy to set up and use, especially since Python is common on most Linux systems.

**No Agent Dependency or Agentless :** It does not require any special software (agent) ansible to the remote system that operates it. It communicates via SSH, which reduces maintenance and avoids performance issues.

**YAML Playbook :** Ansible uses YAML to write its instructions and configuration. YAML is easy to read and understand, making it ideal for managing configuration and automating tasks.

**Ansible Galaxy :** Ansible Galaxy is a central place to find and share Ansible content. It helps users quickly download and use pre-created roles for tasks like installing applications and configuring servers, speeding up deployment.

### Disadvantages of Ansible

Ansible is a powerful tool for automating network tasks and managing configuration. However it has some limitations.

**Basic User Interface :** Ansible was originally just a command line interface and later added web-based tools like AWX and Ansible Tower. However, these tools still have limitations and may not always sync well with the command line, causing potential conflicts.

**Lack of state management :** Unlike some other tools like Puppet, Ansible doesn't keep track of current state or configuration dependencies. This makes it less suitable for situations where detailed state management is required.

**Limited Windows Support :** Ansible's support for Windows is limited. It can manage Windows machines using PowerShell, but you need a Linux machine to control them, which makes cross-platform management less seamless.

Overall, Ansible is a free open source tool for automating IT tasks, setting up systems and managing workflows. Written in Python and used via the command line or ssh. It is known to be simple and beginner friendly and secure.
