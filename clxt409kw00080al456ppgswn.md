Okay in my point of view public cloud is accessble for everyone. If we have an account with the public cloud vendor and we good to go, also then the cloud operator kept multiple option which allowing us to pick and choose right tools and solution according to our requirements. The public cloud vendors like AWS, Azure, GCP create this infrastructure multiple places around the globe and they can maintain their data centres by their own we just need to pay as what we used.

**Public Cloud & Reson behind moving towards it :**

People and Organization move to the public cloud cause they want to get rid of this maintainance. As we know the data centre always need attention network, room temparature, security issues, and dedicated employees to keep their eyes open for 24/7 and a particular space or room and also need more capital to maintain all these things.

**Benefits of Public Clouds :**

1\. First thing first it is all about cost-effective. 2. It is easy to go with public cloud just create an account with any of public cloud vendors and starts creating resources onboard. Those are the benefits of public cloud.

# **Now talks about Private Cloud üîê !**

Private cloud where is the infrastructure dedicated or exclusively operated to a particular organization from a cloud service providers physical boundries. Its within this organization it is not shared with other organizations no one can't access the virtual server from it.

**Benefits & key feature of Private Cloud :**

We can design our own private cloud as per our needs. It have all three basic features in private cloud

1. **Security :** It located behind the firewall only can access through secure network links, rather than public internet.
    
2. **Isolation :** All cloud vendors can provide (Virtual Private Cloud)VPC type of isolation between different organizaions that vpc resources avilable in public cloud.
    
3. **Technologies :** Private clouds also can use technologies like virtualization, automation, and management software.
