For accessibility and identity management is an important aspect in todayâ€™s world because it gives assurance that only the right authorized users have access to systems, data and applications. One of its major functions is preventing unauthorized access to data resulting into loss of sensitive information (data breaches). This is more crucial for cloud computing and working from home managing a team.

**Why we uses IAM here are some for the resons of IAM in short:**  
**Protection against identity-based attacks :** IAM prevents identity-based attacks and data breaches facilitated by unauthorized personnel with excessive access.  
**Preservation of digital identities :** IAM protects digital identities through standards and protocols that ensure user credentials are safe and guarded against any invasion.  
**Appropriate employee access :** IAM provides that relevant employees in possession of vital information can access it as well as having security clearances matching their respective jobs.  
**Support for federated identity :** The majority of IAM frameworks incorporate federated identity which entails having one electronic identity recognized as well as stored by different systems.  
**Authentication is required :** IAM makes it compulsory for users to authenticate themselves before having the right to enter a system or software program.  
**Governance is included :** This contains a governance model where there exists creation and proper management of all the needed policies, processes, and standards that touch on IAM functionalities.  
**Regular audits are required :** This requires regular checks so that the least privilege principle holds firm.
