Kubernetes is a free and open-source software which helps to manage the containers over any kind of infrastructure be it on premise, hybrid or a public cloud. It also performs load dispersion, balancing and scaling of the containers in a perfunctory manner. It was created by Google but is currently administered by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is an abstraction that enables deployment and operation of a large number of containers as clusters. The language of implementation is Go. Kubernetes enjoys a healthy community and integrates with all major cloud providers which puts it at the forefront in the management of containers over various competing devices.

### Reason Behind Kubernetes arise.

From Physical Servers to Containers and Kubernetes. In the early days of IT everything was managed on physical servers which is a costly, inefficient and vulnerable setup. As technology progressed virtual systems emerged and allowing multiple virtual operating systems to run on a single hardware setup, improving efficiency and optimizing hardware usage.

Recognizing that applications do not require any complete operating system but only specific features leads to containerization. They are small and lightweight units that divide applications into parts called microservices. This approach improves security, simplifies tasks and ensures a consistent environment for both development and operations teams.

With the rise of container usage Kubernetes has become the standard tool for managing and running containerized applications. Developed by Google and released as open-source in 2014 Kubernetes leverages Google’s deep expertise in container management and built on their internal system called Borg. It simplifies deployment through automated container orchestration, improving reliability and saving time and resources on daily operations.

### Why We Need to Use Kubernetes (k8s) !!

**Saves time and effort :** Kubernetes allows developers to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure, making it easier to scale applications.

**Keeps apps running smoothly :** This helps maintain app performance even when servers fail or traffic spikes, reducing emergency fixes.

**Saves costs :** Kubernetes optimizes hardware usage, which can reduce costs.

**Ensures Reliability :** It keeps applications available with minimal downtime and can handle a variety of workloads.

**Increases productivity :** By efficiently managing resources and supporting automatic scaling, Kubernetes increases productivity and reduces risk.

### Features of Kubernetes

Kubernetes comes with many features that make it such a joy to work with.

**Automated scheduling :** One of the biggest features of Kubernetes is that it comes loaded with automatic scheduling, which is exactly what it sounds like. In Kubernetes we have a cluster that can have N number of nodes. Now, when a container is launched it needs to be attached to a node. Kubernetes nodes manage which pods should be attached based on constraints such as required resources.

**Self-healing capabilities :** One of the fantastic feature of Kubernetes is Self-healing for developers. It solves the problem by automatically redeploying and replacing containers when a node fails. It also removes containers that do not pass health checks and ensuring that defective containers are not visible to users. Additionally if we use deployments Kubernetes will automatically recreate the container to maintain the desired number of replicas set by the creator.

**Automated rollbacks and rollouts :** This feature is really useful for updating our running apps. Imagine we have an application with multiple pods and containers. When we want to update it Kubernetes handles it smoothly by replacing old versions with new ones without causing any downtime. If we find a problem with the new update, we can simply roll back to the previous version without any interruption thanks to Kubernetes.

**Horizontal scaling and load balancing :** This feature is a huge plus point for us. For example, if we work for an e-commerce company and there are times like holidays or festivals sales when our website experiences a lot of traffic. During these peak times we need more instances to handle the extra load. Kubernetes makes this easy by letting us scale our application up or down with simple commands. This ensures that traffic is spread evenly across all instances so no single pod feel that it overloaded.

### Architecture of Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes uses a client-server setup. The master runs on one machine while the nodes run on separate Linux machines. The master controls the Docker containers across these nodes which are known as walker nodes. Together the master and worker nodes form a **Kubernetes Cluster**. Developers use Kubernetes Master to deploy applications in Docker containers.

### Kubernetes - Master Node Components

The Kubernetes master is responsible for managing the entire cluster. It controls everything that happens inside the cluster and communicates with worker nodes to keep everything running smoothly including our application. It is where all the administrative work is conducted. When we install Kubernetes master comes with four main components that are set up on your system.

**API Server :** API Server is the main entry point for managing a Kubernetes cluster. All administrative tasks, like creating, deleting, updating or displaying objects everything go through this server. It manages and configures various components of Kubernetes like pods, services and deployments and exposes APIs for all operations. We interact with these APIs using a tool called kubectl. kubectl is a small command line tool that allows us to run commands and manage our Kubernetes Cluster.

**Scheduler :** The Kubernetes master scheduler is in charge of workload distribution. It monitors the utilization of each worker node and places new workloads on nodes with available resources. It determines where to place pods based on the rules and limits we have set. This helps us to ensure that resources are well utilized and that pods go to the appropriate nodes.

**Controller Manager :** Controllers in Kubernetes act like alert managers. They run in the background to keep the cluster in its desired state performing tasks like creating namespaces, cleaning up unused resources and managing pods. If something goes wrong the controllers automatically fix it to match the desired setup. Key controllers include those for replication, endpoints, namespaces and service accounts. Which ensure us everything in the cluster runs smoothly and as expected.

**etcd :** It is a lightweight distributed key-value database used in Kubernetes. It acts as a central store for the current state of the cluster and holds configuration details like subnets and config maps. It ensures us that all configuration and state information is properly stored and managed.

### Kubernetes - Worker Node Components

Kubernetes worker nodes contain all the necessary services to manage networking between containers, communicate with the master node and allocate resources to the containers they manage.

**Kubelet :** Kubelet is the core agent running on each worker node of a Kubernetes cluster. It communicates with the master node and receives pod specifications from the API server. Kubelet ensures that the containers described in the pods are running and healthy. If Kubelet detects a problem with the pods it will try to restart them on the same node. If the problem is with the worker node itself Kubernetes will detect the failure then move the pods to a healthy node.

**Kube-Proxy :** Kube-Proxy is the core networking component of a Kubernetes cluster. It manages network configuration and ensures that the network is consistent across all nodes, pods and containers. Kube-Proxy acts as a network proxy and load balancer handling TCP and UDP traffic and exposing services to the outside world. It listens to the API server for updates on service endpoints and sets up routing to ensure each service can be reached correctly.

**Pods :** A pod is a group of containers deployed together on the same host. Pods allow us to place multiple related containers together, acting as a wrapper around them. This makes it easier to manage and interact with these containers as a single unit.

### Benefits of Kubernetes

Businesses are adopting Kubernetes for its powerful and flexible container management. It works across major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Kubernetes simplifies resource management through auto-scaling, adjusts resources based on traffic, and helps reduce costs. It automatically fixes or replaces failed containers, increasing reliability by reducing downtime. Developers use JSON or YAML files to set up applications and Kubernetes ensures that everything is consistent, making management and deployment easier.

**Scalability :** Supports automatic horizontal scaling of pods based on traffic and load, ensuring applications can efficiently handle different levels of demand.

**High availability :** Achieves high availability for applications and minimizes latency issues for end users.

**Cost-effectiveness :** Optimizes resource utilization and controls additional measures to reduce infrastructure costs.

I**mproved developer productivity :** Allows us to focus on coding by automating infrastructure management and routine operations.

### Difference Docker vs Kubernetes

### Deployment in kubernetes

In Kubernetes a deployment manages a group of identical pods running our application ensuring that multiple copies (replicas) are always up and running. If a pod fails or crashes deployment automatically replaces it to keep our application available.

Deployments use pod templates to specify how each pod should be configured including details like volumes and labels. When we update pod templates Kubernetes gradually replaces old pods with new ones that have the updated configuration.

### Application of Kubernetes

**Microservices architecture :** Kubernetes is ideal for managing microservices architectures that break down complex applications into small and modular components that can be deployed and managed independently.

**Cloud-native development :** Kubernetes is essential for cloud-native development that focuses on building applications that run on cloud infrastructure and leverage its scalability, flexibility and resilience.
