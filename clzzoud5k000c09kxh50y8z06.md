How about let's write the First Script in Bash .

Step 1 : Prerequisites are we need a debian model ubuntu linux lts : latest version

As soon as we log into it we can write a script for our hands-on.

Make a separated dir for these scripts

And last one to create a shell file with this command

```typescript
$ touch hello.sh 
or 
$ vim hello.sh
```

Step 2 Let's write the script,,,

```typescript
#!/bin/bash
<< Comment 
First Script 
Comment

echo "Me : Hello World !! What do you want to be when you grow up !!"

echo "Folks : A Shell Writer <)) A Globe known Key-Word"

echo "Me : Work On it now Or Regret for it Later"
```

step 3 : Yup We will write it like this. And save it with :wq â†©

Step : 4 After we back on the terminal again here are the multiple way to print but there is a hook.

```typescript
$ cat hello.sh
```

Through this we can easily only print out the script like this.

Steps : 5 To execute this script or make executable we need to give permissions about who mean users, groups, others can access what by this command.

```typescript
$ chmod 755 hello.sh
```

```typescript
$ bash hello.sh
or 
$ ./hello.sh
```

Steps 6 : Shell Here we how execute a shell file.

This is way through which we can write a Script and then execute them .
